I have worked extensively as a clinical assistant, combining technical expertise with compassionate patient care. My experience includes managing patient recruitment and screening for mental health research, conducting detailed medical record reviews, and guiding patients through informed consent processes. Before this, I volunteered at community clinics, where I honed my skills in triaging patients, collecting medical histories, and administering treatments. These experiences, combined with my research background, reflect my commitment to precise clinical practices and patient-centered care.
